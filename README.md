# msp430-morse-code-comm-platform
This project consists of a Morse Code Communication Platform using MSP430FG4618/F2013 Experimenter Board and Serial Communication with a Workstation.  The big square pad at the center of the Capacitive Touch Pad is used as a button to create the Morse code and the F2013 sends the state of the capacitive pad to the FG4618 through I2C.  In the FG4618, the buzzer will play the corresponding dots/lines and decode the Morse code and send it to the workstation using UART.  The workstation will receive the resulting characters of the Morse code on a Serial terminal. The Workstation will also be able to send a message that will then be played by the buzzer using the equivalent Morse code.
